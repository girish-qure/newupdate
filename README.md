    docker login
    take postgres backup of previous version
    make changes in env files, copy previous env variable in new envs
    make changes in yml, change volume names as previous one, make new one for postgress
    deploy dockers, apihub, cxr dcmio and monitoring stuff
    restore postgres backup in new version
    run migration in api hub and will take care of cors header
    run migrations in cxr
    commit apihub
